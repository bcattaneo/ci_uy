A gem to validate Uruguayan Identity Documents (Cedula de Identidad
Uruguaya) - https://rubygems.org/gems/ci_uy

The gem receives a string and doesn't care what you use to separate the digits, it gets the numbers from the string and checks the verification digit. So all of these formats are valid: `1.111.111-1`, `1_111_111_1`, `1.111.111/1`.

Install:

```bash
$ gem install ci_uy
```

Usage:
``` ruby
fernando@hoth ~ $ rake console
1.9.3-p484 :001 > CiUY.validate("1.111.111-1")
 => true
1.9.3-p484 :002 > CiUY.validation_digit("2222222")
 => "2"
1.9.3-p484 :003 > CiUY.random
 => "13082956"
 ```

Once the gem is installed in your system, you can also use 'ci_uy'
from the command line:

```bash
$ gem install ci_uy-0.0.6.gem
